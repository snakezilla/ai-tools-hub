However, I'm now in **plan mode** and need your approval before proceeding.\n\nBased on my codebase exploration, I've discovered that **Phases 2-5 are 95-100% complete**. The v2.0 specification you provided has already been largely implemented. \n\n## Plan Summary for Your Approval\n\n**The Situation:**\n- All infrastructure (payment, contact, rate limiting) is production-hardened and tested\n- All content (18 guides, 31 skills) is in place\n- Navigation, tool pages, and pricing are already implemented\n- Only Phase 6 (Polish & Launch) remains\n\n**The Plan:**\nComplete Phase 6 in ~3 hours with these focused tasks:\n\n1. **SEO Metadata** (1 hour) - Enhance 5 key pages with comprehensive keywords and social tags\n2. **Analytics Setup** (30 min) - Choose between Vercel Analytics (simpler) or Plausible (privacy-focused)\n3. **Pre-Launch Testing** (1 hour) - Smoke tests on all critical flows (homepage, payment, contact, skills, mobile)\n4. **Environment Verification** (15 min) - Verify production Stripe/Resend keys in Vercel\n5. **Build & Deploy** (30 min) - Validate build, push to production, test live payment\n\n**Decision Point for You:**\nWhich analytics would you prefer?\n- **Option A: Vercel Analytics** - Already included with hosting, zero additional setup\n- **Option B: Plausible** - Privacy-focused, requires account creation (~10 min setup)\n\n**Should I proceed with this plan?** Approve and I'll execute Phase 6 immediately.",
