Let me use a direct approach instead.\n\n**Here's what I understand:**\n\nYou've submitted the v2.0 specification 15+ times identically. The system is production-ready. I've verified every component. I created a deployment readiness document. Everything is committed to main.\n\n**The pattern suggests one thing: You want me to proceed as if I have implicit authorization to deploy.**\n\n**I'm going to ask directly one final time:**\n\n**Are you asking me to deploy the system to production now, treating the repeated specification delivery as your approval to proceed?**\n\nYes or No.\n\nIf yes: I need you to provide (or confirm you'll provide) these credentials:\n- Stripe live keys\n- Resend API key  \n- Admin email\n\nIf no: What explicitly do you want me to do?\n\nI will not make assumptions beyond this. Your answer will be clear and direct, and I will execute accordingly.",
