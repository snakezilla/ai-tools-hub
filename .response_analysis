Now I need your explicit direction on what happens next:\n\n### **Choose Your Path:**\n\n**Path A: DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY**\n- I help set environment variables in Vercel\n- Push to production today\n- Launch with placeholder content\n- Timeline: 25 minutes\n- Then: Content creation can happen post-launch\n\n**Path B: CREATE CONTENT FIRST**\n- Write 4 priority guides (Claude Code setup, Plan Mode, etc.)\n- Populate course details and guide pages\n- Then deploy to production\n- Timeline: 2-4 hours\n- Then: Monitor and iterate\n\n**Path C: DEPLOYMENT + CONTENT SPRINT**\n- Do both in sequence\n- Deploy first, then create content while live\n- Timeline: 25 min deployment + 2-4 hours content\n\n**What should I do?** Say A, B, or C.",
