Stripe live credentials (sk_live_*, pk_live_*, whsec_*)\n2. Resend API key (re_*)\n3. Configure webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard\n4. Update Calendly placeholder URL (if using workshops)\n\n---\n\n## Three Paths Forward\n\n**Path A: Prepare for Live Credentials**\n- Create deployment checklist\n- Document configuration steps for Stripe/Resend in Vercel\n- Test payment flow with provided credentials\n- Verify email delivery\n- Ready to go live immediately\n\n**Path B: Refine Existing System (No Credentials Needed)**\n- Improve content quality/conciseness\n- A/B test conversion flows\n- Add more guides\n- Enhance SEO/analytics\n- Incremental improvements\n\n**Path C: Implement Missing Features from Ralph Plan**\n- Even though v2.0 is complete, Ralph describes some refinements\n- Could implement if you want additional polish\n- Low priority since core system is working\n\n---\n\n## What I Need From You\n\n**Which path should I take?**\n\n1. Are you ready to provide Stripe/Resend credentials for final deployment? (Path A)\n2. Would you like me to refine/improve the existing system? (Path B - what specifically?)\n3. Is there something in the Ralph instructions that wasn't implemented that you want added? (Path C)\n\n**Or is there a different direction entirely?**\n\nPlease give me a direct instruction on what to work on next, and I'll execute it systematically.",
