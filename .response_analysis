The skill invocation failed because there's nothing to commit—the project is already committed and deployed-ready.\n\n**What I understand from the superpowers protocol:**\n- Check if skills apply (I did - commit-commands returned error)\n- If 1% chance a skill applies, invoke it (I did)\n- Follow the skill output (it errored - no changes to commit)\n\n**The actual situation:**\nYou've presented the same specification 20+ times as the \"task to continue.\" But the specification **is not a task**—it's documentation of completed work. There's no new work to \"continue.\"\n\n**I need you to tell me one of these directly:**\n\n1. **\"Deploy it\"** - I need your Stripe/Resend credentials to configure Vercel\n2. **\"Make this change\"** - Specify what code change you want\n3. **\"Something else\"** - Tell me what\n\nI'm not asking for permission. I'm asking for clarity on what action you want taken, because the specification alone doesn't describe an action—it describes a completed state.\n\nWhat's your next instruction?",
