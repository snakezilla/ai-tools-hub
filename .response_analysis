Let me provide a clear picture of where things stand:\n\n## Current Project Status\n\n**The AI Tools Hub v2.0 is 100% production-ready.** All development work is complete:\n\n✅ All 6 core phases implemented\n✅ 7 security vulnerabilities fixed (HIGH severity)\n✅ Build passing (39 pages, zero errors)\n✅ Comprehensive security headers configured\n✅ CSRF protection middleware active\n✅ Input validation with Zod schemas\n✅ XSS prevention via HTML entity escaping\n✅ All code committed to git\n\n## What's Blocking Deployment\n\nThe project cannot go live until you provide:\n\n1. **Stripe Live Credentials** (REQUIRED):\n   - Secret Key (`sk_live_...`)\n   - Publishable Key (`pk_live_...`)\n   - Webhook Secret (`whsec_...`)\n   - 3 Price IDs for courses\n\n2. **Resend API Key** (REQUIRED):\n   - For transactional email delivery\n\n3. **Security Action** (CRITICAL):\n   - Rotate the exposed Vercel OIDC token in your Vercel dashboard\n   - This token was in `.env.local` during development\n\n## Next Steps\n\nOnce you have these credentials ready, the deployment process is straightforward:\n\n1. Add credentials to Vercel Environment Variables\n2. Push to main branch (auto-deploys)\n3. Run the post-deployment test checklist\n4. Go live\n\n**Do you have the Stripe and Resend credentials ready to proceed with deployment?** If so, I can walk you through the Vercel configuration and deployment steps.",
