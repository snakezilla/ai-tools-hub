# AI Tools Hub Cold Email Campaign Strategy

A comprehensive Hormozi-style value-first cold outreach campaign to generate leads and fill workshops.

---

## Executive Summary

Based on deep research of the AI Tools Hub website, the Hormozi framework, and industry AI adoption trends, this plan outlines a cold email campaign offering **free resources and workshops** to businesses. The strategy follows Alex Hormozi's core principles:

- **Give to Ask Ratio**: Offer massive value upfront before asking for anything
- **Lead Magnets**: Free resources so good people would pay for them
- **No-Brainer Offers**: Make the free workshop too valuable to refuse
- **Personalization at Scale**: Industry-specific messaging that feels 1:1

## Top 3 Sectors to Niche Down

After analyzing AI adoption rates, pain points, and ROI potential, here are the **top 3 sectors** for AI Tools Hub:

- **Clear time savings** - Content creation, SEO, social media management are obvious automation targets

- **High ROI visibility** - Time saved = billable hours regained

**Key Pain Points:**
- Data silos across platforms (analytics, CRM, social)

- Keeping up with rapid AI tool changes

**Tools from Your Hub They Need:**

### 🎯 MARKETING AGENCIES

#### Email 1: The Value Bomb (Lead Magnet Offer)

```
Subject: Put together something for [Agency Name]

Hi [First Name],

I came across [Agency Name]'s work on [specific campaign/client] — really impressive how you [genuine compliment about their strategic approach].

I run AI Tools Hub, and I put together a short guide for agency founders and senior marketers who want to give their team a productivity edge:

"The Agency Owner's AI Toolkit: 7 Tools That Give Your Team 10+ Extra Hours/Week"

What's in it:
→ How agencies are using Claude to speed up first drafts (your writers polish, AI handles the blank page)
→ A Zapier workflow that automatically pulls client reporting together
→ Why Perplexity is becoming the go-to research tool for strategists

The idea isn't to replace your people — it's to free them up for the work that actually requires their expertise.

Here's the guide (no signup, just the PDF): [link]

If any of it resonates, I'd be curious to hear what you're seeing on the AI front at [Agency Name].

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. I'm also happy to hop on a Zoom and run a free 60-minute hands-on workshop for your team. We'd walk through exactly how to set up Claude for content drafts and Zapier for automated reporting. No pitch, just training. Let me know if that's useful.
```

#### Email 2: The Curiosity Hook (3 days later)

```
Subject: Re: Put together something for [Agency Name]

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to follow up on the toolkit I sent over.

I've been working with a few agency owners lately, and the pattern I keep seeing: the teams using these tools aren't working less — they're taking on more clients without burning out.

The math is straightforward:
→ 10 hrs/week saved per person × 5 team members = 50 hours back
→ That's essentially a free junior hire's worth of capacity

The tools themselves are simple once someone shows you the setup. That's what we do in the workshop.

I'm happy to hop on a Zoom call and run a free 60-minute session with your team. We'd cover Claude for content, Zapier for reporting automation, and Perplexity for research — all hands-on, everyone leaves with something working.

Worth an hour?

[Your Name]
```

#### Email 3: The Social Proof (7 days later)

```
Subject: What other agency owners are telling me

Hi [First Name],

Quick note — I've run these workshops for about a dozen agencies now, and the feedback I keep hearing:

"I knew I should be using this stuff, but I didn't know where to start. This gave my team a real foundation."

That's the goal. Not to turn everyone into AI experts, but to give your senior people tools that handle the tedious parts so they can focus on strategy and client work.

The workshop is still free. We'd do it over Zoom. 60 minutes, hands-on with Claude, Zapier, and Perplexity. Your team walks away with at least one automation actually running.

If that sounds useful, just reply and we'll find a time.

### 📊 ACCOUNTING FIRMS

#### Email 1: The Value Bomb

```
Subject: Put this together for firms like [Firm Name]

Hi [First Name],

I work with accounting firms on getting practical value from AI tools — nothing fancy, just the stuff that actually saves time.

I put together a short guide for firm partners and managers:

"The Accountant's AI Playbook: Give Your Team 10+ Hours Back Every Week"

What's in it:
→ How to use Claude to summarize long financial documents in under a minute (your staff reviews, AI handles the initial read-through)
→ A Zapier workflow that routes invoices to the right person automatically
→ Why ChatGPT's voice feature is surprisingly useful for drafting client emails between meetings

The goal isn't to change how your firm operates — it's to take the repetitive work off your team's plate so they can focus on the advisory work that matters.

Here's the guide (no signup required): [link]

Hope it's helpful,
[Your Name]

P.S. I'm also happy to hop on a Zoom and run a free 60-minute workshop for your team. We'd walk through Claude for document review, Zapier for invoice routing, and ChatGPT for client communication — all hands-on. No sales pitch, just training. Let me know if that would be useful.
```

#### Email 2: The Pain Point (3 days later)

```
Subject: Re: Put this together for firms like [Firm Name]

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to follow up on the guide I sent.

One thing I keep hearing from firm partners: "My team is spending 5-10 hours a week on work that feels like it should be automated by now."

Data entry, document summarization, chasing down the same information across systems — it adds up.

That's 250+ hours per year, per person, that could go toward actual client work.

These AI tools aren't complicated once someone walks you through them. That's what I do in the workshop.

I'm happy to jump on a Zoom call and run a free 60-minute hands-on session. We'd cover Claude for document review, Zapier for routing workflows, and ChatGPT for client drafts. Everyone leaves with at least one automation working.

Worth an hour of your team's time?

#### Email 3: The Trust Builder (7 days later)

```
Subject: Just checking in

Hi [First Name],

I know it's a busy time for firms, so I'll keep this short.

I've run these workshops for 15+ accounting firms now. The consistent feedback: "We knew AI could help, but we didn't know where to start. This gave us a real starting point."

The workshop is still free. We'd do it over Zoom. 60 minutes, hands-on, your team walks away with tools they can actually use.

I'm not selling software or subscriptions — just helping firms get their people comfortable with tools that save time.

Whenever the timing works, just reply and we'll set it up.

### 🏠 REAL ESTATE AGENCIES

#### Email 1: The Value Bomb

```
Subject: Put this together for brokerages like [Agency Name]

Hi [First Name],

I work with real estate brokerages on getting practical value from AI tools — the stuff that actually helps agents close more deals without adding to their workload.

I put together a short guide for broker-owners and team leads:

"The Real Estate AI Toolkit: 7 Tools That Help Your Agents Win More Deals"

What's in it:
→ How Claude writes solid property descriptions in 30 seconds (your agents review and personalize, AI handles the first draft)
→ A Zapier workflow that follows up with new leads automatically — so no one falls through the cracks
→ Why Perplexity is becoming the fastest way to pull comps and market data

The idea isn't to replace your agents' relationship skills — it's to free them up from the busywork so they can focus on clients.

Here's the guide (no signup, just the PDF): [link]

[Your Name]

P.S. I'm also happy to hop on a Zoom and run a free 60-minute workshop for your team. We'd walk through Claude for listings, Zapier for lead follow-up, and Perplexity for market research — all hands-on, everyone leaves with something working. No pitch. Let me know if that's useful.
```

#### Email 2: The Competitive Angle (3 days later)

```
Subject: Re: Put this together for brokerages like [Agency Name]

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to follow up on the toolkit I sent.

One thing I keep hearing from broker-owners: the agents who are adopting these tools aren't working longer hours — they're just responding faster.

Faster lead follow-up (Zapier sends the first reply automatically).
Faster listings (Claude drafts descriptions in seconds).
Faster market answers for clients (Perplexity pulls data instantly).

In real estate, that speed often makes the difference.

I'm happy to jump on a Zoom call and run a free 60-minute hands-on workshop for your team. Everyone walks away knowing exactly how to set up these tools.

Worth considering?

[Your Name]
```

#### Email 3: The Relationship Builder (7 days later)

```
Subject: One more thought

Hi [First Name],

I know real estate moves fast and this might not be the right time — totally understand.

But if you've been thinking about getting your team up to speed on AI tools, I'm happy to make it easy:

I'll hop on Zoom, run a free 60-minute workshop, and walk your agents through the exact setup for Claude (listings), Zapier (lead follow-up), and Perplexity (market research).

No pitch at the end. Just training that helps your people work smarter.

The agents I've trained tell me it's the best hour they've spent on "technology stuff" — because it's practical, not theoretical.

Whenever the timing works, just reply.
